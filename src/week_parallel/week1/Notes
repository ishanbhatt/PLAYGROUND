JAVA MEMORY MODEL RULES :-

1) Two threads writing to separate locations in memory do not need synchronization
2) A thread X that calls join on another thread Y is guaranteed to observe all the writes by thread Y after join returns.
    We saw this in AccRunner our main thread calls join on threads s,t so, it will observe all the changes by them

Eventually it all boils down to 2 constructs,
1) threads
2) synchronization
